# Week 6

[hours](https://github.com/korolainenriikka/jani/blob/master/documentation/hourly_report.md)

Still a lot of other stuff going on in life this week.

## What I did

* finished and implemented heap structure
* finished the better evaluator
* improved unit & performance testing
* worked on the transposition table

## How things are going

Everything except the transposition table is basically done, some static evaluation factors could be empirically fine-tuned, but as that teaches nothing and is rather
boring I might as well skip the part and focus on creating a transposition table.

The table feature is rather complex and will require some work until I am able to implement it to this game so that the bot will actually improve. However, as I still have
a couple weeks left, I might as well try

## Problems

## Remaining weeks todo
