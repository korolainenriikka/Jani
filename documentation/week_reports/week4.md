# Week 4

[hours](https://github.com/korolainenriikka/jani/blob/master/documentation/hourly_report.md)

Other life is happening somewhat more this and next week so progress will probably not be as grand as on previous weeks; hopefully I will be able to pick this better
back up on the last weeks.

## What I did

* further research on advanced bot features
* fixed client and alpha-beta bugs
* started coding a better evaluator and noticed it is challenging
* started the implementation of progressive deepening using java libraries
* updated documentation

## How things are going

This stage required a lot more research than before; the basic bot is up and runnig, and improving will require implementation of more advanced features.
Only time will show whether these efforts actually produce a better bot and how much better it will be; othello is not as popular of a game as chess so
it is not set-in-stone which features actually make a good program.

## Problems

* evaluation function: determining various features requires more computation than would be ideal; the function should remain really fast. In this sense othello
is much more challenging than chess.

## Next week

* done: the better evaluator and the library-using progressively deepening bot
* started: min/max heap implementation, library-using transistion table
* research: transisition table
* some code cleanup is also needed
