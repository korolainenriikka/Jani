# Week 3

[hours](https://github.com/korolainenriikka/jani/blob/master/documentation/hourly_report.md)

## What I did

* did first version of minimax and a simple evaluator
* added a feature to the client
* started performance testing for finding optimal minimax depths

## How things are going

Current bot has the basic algorithms implemented but does not play especially well; random is beated in about 2/3 of the games played, dummy is won only if current bot plays as player 2. 

## Problems

* testing minimax is hard; it is hard to determine what the bot should choose to do

## Next week

* next week there should be an algorithm using pruning and updated minimax depths to compute deeper. Possibly state value hashing using java.util libraries
