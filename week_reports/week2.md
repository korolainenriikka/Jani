# Week 2

[hours](https://github.com/korolainenriikka/jani/blob/master/documentation/hourly_report.md)

## What I did

* created a dummy bot and some bot utils for handling the game
* finished the clien program

## Problems
The interaction of bots and implementation of the bot algoritms will be a challenge; these are things I have not done before. However, I'm sure I will figure everything out step by step.

## Questions 

* On the game client: is it better for the game program to give the current state of the game as a 2d array or as a board interface with methods to fetch individual tile values and the board size?
* On directory structure and git: client has a separate repository, this has another. Tried to implement git submodule, but is this better? This repo only has my bot code and instructions for the use of
the client use / git link to the client
